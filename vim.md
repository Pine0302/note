                    Lesson 2.3: ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS
  Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
  The format for a delete command with the  d  delete operator is as follows:

        d   motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

  Thus typing  de  will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.

NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will
       move the cursor as specified.
```
```
    Lesson 2.4: USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION


   ** Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. **

  1. Move the cursor to the start of the line below marked --->.

  2. Type  2w  to move the cursor two words forward.

  3. Type  3e  to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.

  4. Type  0  (zero) to move to the start of the line.

  5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different numbers.

---> This is just a line with words you can move around in.

  6. Move on to lesson 2.5.
```
```
  Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE


   ** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **

  In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
         d   number   motion

  1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked --->.

  2. Type  d2w  to delete the two UPPER CASE words.

  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
     UPPER CASE words with one command.

--->  this ABC DE line FGHI JK LMN OP of words is Q RS TUV cleaned up.
```
```
                   Lesson 2.6: OPERATING ON LINES


                   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **

  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided
  it would be easier to simply type two d's to delete a line.

  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
  3. Now move to the fourth line.
  4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.
```

```
                        Lesson 2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND


   ** Press  u  to undo the last commands,   U  to fix a whole line. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ---> and place it on the
     first error.
  2. Type  x  to delete the first unwanted character.
  3. Now type  u  to undo the last command executed.
  4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the  x  command.
  5. Now type a capital  U  to return the line to its original state.
  6. Now type  u  a few times to undo the  U  and preceding commands.
  7. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times
     to redo the commands (undo the undo's).

---> Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

  8. These are very useful commands.  Now move on to the lesson 2 Summary.

```

```
                               Lesson 2 SUMMARY


  1. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:    dw
  2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:    d$
  3. To delete a whole line type:    dd

  4. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
  5. The format for a change command is:
               operator   [number]   motion
     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
                  $ (to the end of line), etc.

  6. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

  7. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
     To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R
